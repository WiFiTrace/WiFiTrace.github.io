## Dependencies and Installation
The code works with Python 3.7 and is also Python 2.7 compatible. You need to install Python (3.7 preferred) and the following list of packages:
  * [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html)
  * datetime, os, ast, sys, get_opt are all part of pythonâ€™s standard library. 

## Directory Structure and File Name Format

### Contact Tracing Tool:

<To Be Added>

### Preprocessor : (WiFi Syslogs to Session Extraction System)

The directory structure of Preprocessor is as follows:

\Preprocessor  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- \src  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- \utils  
    
src directory : This directory has all the python code/script files  
utils directory : This directory has additional python scripts for doing postprocessing on the output file.  

## Data Format

### Preprocessor : WiFi Syslogs to Sessions Extraction System:

**Input Data Format :**

HP Aruba WiFi log Format: The WiFi log of HP Aruba also called syslog file contains a list of events.
A typical event message in the Wifi log/syslog looks as below:

hh:mm:ss <controller_name> <process_id> <message_subtype> <controller_name masked_IP> <message_body>

This is the log file generated by HP Aruba WiFi Access Point. It is the input file to extract trajectories from WiFi logs.

**Output Data Format :**

The Preprocessor generates a csv file . Each row of the csv file represents a device session.
The columns in the csv file are 

  MAC,Session_AP_Name,Year,Month,Date,Start_Time,End_Time,Unix_Start_Time,Unix_End_Time

Field Description:

    MAC: (MAC Id of the device)
    Session_AP_Name: Access Point Name/ID where device was connected
    Year: YYYY
    Month: MMM (eg: Jan, Feb, Mar, etc)
    Date: DD (01-31)
    Start_Time : Start time of session in HH:MM (24-hr format)
    End_Time : End time of session in HH:MM (24-hr format)
    Unix_Start_Time : Start time of session in Unix Timestamp
    Unix_End_Time : End time of session in Unix Timestamp
    
    
## Usage
### Contact Tracing Tool:


### Preprocessor (Syslog to Session File):

main.py -y \<YYYY\> -i \<input\> -o \<output\>

where:
i - input syslog file name or directory (if multiple files to be preprocessed)
o - output file name or directory
y - Year (YYYY format) of the syslog file passed in -i, default is current year

**Note:**
1. If Output file parameter -o option is a directory then the outfile is saved as a <input_filename>_sessions.csv

Example:
main.py -y 2019 -i /data/20190111_syslog -o /session/

will process the syslog file present at location /data/20190111_syslog and create an output file in /session/ dir with name 20190111_syslog_sessions.csv

2. If Input parameter is a directory then the script processes all syslog files in the directory that haven't been processed earlier and generates the corresponding session output files.
