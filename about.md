In the [Code repo](https://github.com/umassos/WiFiTrace) we are doing a public release of 2 code bases:

- Contact Tracing Tool [WiFiTrace](https://github.com/umassos/WiFiTrace/tree/master/WiFiTrace)
- Code base of an entire system to extract user device sessions from HP Aruba Access Point Logs [Preprocessor](https://github.com/umassos/WiFiTrace/tree/master/Preprocessor)

Both, WiFiTrace and Preprocessor are written in python.
